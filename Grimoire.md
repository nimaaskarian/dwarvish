# Dwarvish Shell
A Stonecrafted Solution for Keeping Knife Ear Bastards at Bay

</div>

Them elves and their fancy [Elvish shells](https://elv.sh/) can keep their magics and forest tricks to themselves. Us dwarves crafted our own shell, Dwarvish, to give 'em a proper thrashin' if they ever cross our $PATHs.

Them knife ear bastards ain't worth the stones they crawl under. If they dare step near our Dwarvish shell, they'd be sent packin' faster than a cave bat in daylight.
